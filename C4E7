//A company sells the same product to four different states. Each state has a different rate of tax on the product. Make a program where the user enters the value and destination state of the product and the program returns the final price of the product plus the tax of the state in which it will be sold. If the state you entered is not valid, it will show a message of error.
//State: MG, SP, RJ, MS
//Tax 7% 12% 15% 8%
